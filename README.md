Currently provides the initial, as-is built releases. No attempts to rebuild from source or improve in any way. Some games might have incomprehensible jokes.
All included projects are compiled for windows 64-bit.

Includes:

'Advanced' Hunt the Wumpus [[Windows]](https://github.com/HerrahStrings/scrapped-games/releases/download/windows/WumpusHunt.zip) - A data-driven port of hunt the wumpus, written in C++ , updated with instant controls
(Press H to open the help screen, some controls are still labelled as per the text adventure version).
Modern terminals seem to be incompatible with its method of automatically creating line breaks, so words will be `joinedtogether` unexpectedly

Kinekt [[Windows]](https://github.com/HerrahStrings/scrapped-games/releases/download/windows/Kinekt.exe) - A connect-4 clone in VB.NET with a fully implemented animated graphical output.
